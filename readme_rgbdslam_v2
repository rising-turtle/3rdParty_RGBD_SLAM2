To make rgbdslam_v2 work in indigo:
3/10/2015 - 3/14/2015
  1 substitute the FindG2O.cmake with groovy version of rgbdslam, in my yesterday_code/rgbdslam/cmake_modules, set G2O_ROOT as where the g2o is installed 
  2 compile the OpenCV 2.4.10, which need to replace the system.cpp with this one https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/2.4/modules/core/src/system.cpp as described in http://answers.opencv.org/question/45836/problem-in-installing-opencv-in-ubntu-1204-32-bit-system/
  3 find the GLU include directories, in the EXTERNEL/SiftGPU 
  4 comment /usr/lib/libcxsparse.so.2.2.3, instead /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libcxsparse.so.3.* which the g2o library links to 
  5 delete the code "tf_msg->__connection_header" in the line 221-222 of the file "openni_listener.cpp"
  6 g2o_solver is not compatible because "compiling g2o before install suitesparse-dev", so need to recompile it! 
  7 pcl-1.7 not compatible with rgbdslam_v2, because rgbdslam_v2' CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS has -std=c++0x but pcl-1.7 standalone doesnot has -std=c++0x, which cause the segmentation fault when running rgbdslam by linking to pcl-1.7, so, have to recompile pcl-1.7 with -std=c++0x flag, as described in 
  https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/issues/780
  https://github.com/felixendres/rgbdslam_v2/issues/8
  https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/issues/980
  8 OpenNI headers cannot work under this flag, so have to hack the file /usr/include/XnPlatform.h line 74, comment "#error ...", but instead add #include "Linux-x86/XnPlatformLinux-x86.h" 
  9 rgbdslam may also need other pcl libraries such as libpcl_apps.so, which actually not be used when run rgbdslam 

  10 run bagrgbd.launch, no image, because the message in the bag is different from the parameters in the launch, edit them to be coherent, then it works

  11 : build opencv with CUDA, error -> set arch
  CMake .. -DCUDA_ARCH_BIN="3.0", it works for me when compiling opencv 2.4.10 

  12: uncompatible lib error when link libsiftgpu, have to rebuild it in the 64bit OS. 

3/15/2015 - 3/18/2015
11 three days work: g2o run error, and many g2o::functions not work, because of this definition "add_definitions(${PCL_DEFINITIONS})" in CMakeLists.txt, this cause all the troubles, Thank God! 

4/1/2015 
1 change into ubuntu 14.04.2 64 bit system, link error undefined reference to "g2o::csparse_extension::cs_chol_workspace(***)" ... 
  This is because the (g2o)/EXTERNAL/csparse/cs.h is conflict with that /usr/include/suitesparse/cs.h, which will result in the undefined function problem, !NOTICE: not the function name is wrong, but rather the parameter type is not consistent, careful. 
  BTW, use nm -gD ***.so to check the exported functions and their parameters
